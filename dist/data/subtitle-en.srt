00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,360
Reversing diabetes is a term that usually refers to a significant long-term

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:11,400
improvement in insulin sensitivity in people with type 2 diabetes. People with

3
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:16,640
type 2 diabetes that are able to get their HbA1c below 42 millimoles per mole

4
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:22,200
or 6% without taking diabetes medication are said to have reversed or resolved

5
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:31,320
their diabetes. So how can you have skinny people with type 2 diabetes and

6
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:37,400
this is something that's often called TOFI or TOFI which is thin on the

7
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:43,520
outside fat on the inside. Do you want to learn more about the insulin resistance

8
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:48,160
diet because you think you're insulin resistant? Well you're in the right place.

9
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:54,160
Insulin resistance affects a large proportion of American population and

10
00:00:54,160 --> 00:01:00,120
the rest of the world too. So its presence often goes unnoticed and unchecked for a

11
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:05,200
long time. In adults insulin resistance can progress to pre-diabetes and if left

12
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:10,480
untreated. We divide it into two types of fat subcutaneous fat which is under the

13
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:14,880
skin and visceral fat which is the fat that is concentrated really around the

14
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:22,320
midsection.
